LedFixtureV1 is using xhttp to set the color of the fixture and UDP to sync between all of the selected ones

LedFixtureV2 is using Websoceckt for the color and sync

Using https://github.com/rstephan/ArtnetWifi Arduino library  for Artnet

## MapperAutoCreator.py

used to create a mapping between a 2d space ( your screen ) and the channel of each led for the fixture
this script use your webcam or camera as an input to detect the led and make the correct mapping
it produces the `.npy` file required by the `ScreenToArtnetMapper.py`

## ScreenToArtnetMapper.py

Use `.npy`  file generated by `MapperAutoCreator.py` to map the pixel off your screen and sent them to your ARTNET Fixture

have some shortcut for freezing ( f ), turning black ( b )
changing the gamma with + and -
cycling between the connected display ( * )
changing the position / scale of the mapper ( 1 , 2 , 3 )
